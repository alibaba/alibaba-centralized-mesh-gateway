  **Updated** the "Control Plane Dashboard" and the "Performance Dashboard" to use the `container_memory_working_set_bytes` metric
  to display memory. This metric only counts memory that *cannot be reclaimed* by the kernel even under memory pressure,
  and therefore more relevant for tracking. It is also consistent with `kubectl top`. The reported values are lower than
  the previous values.
