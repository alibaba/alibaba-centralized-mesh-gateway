  **Updated** Telemetry API uses a new native extension for Prometheus stats
  instead of the Wasm-based extension. This improves CPU overhead and memory
  usage of the feature. Custom dimensions no longer require regex and bootstrap
  annotations. If customizations use CEL expressions with Wasm attributes, they
  are likely to be affected.
